        <p id="paratwo">
            Dairy farming is a time-tested industry‚Äîbut it‚Äôs evolving rapidly. Today‚Äôs consumers are more conscious than
            ever of where their food comes from. They value clean-label products, sustainable farming, and animal
            welfare. With shifting dietary preferences and an increasing emphasis on organic nutrition, the demand for
            responsibly-sourced milk and dairy products is booming.This is where Friends Dairy stands out. We blend
            time-honored agricultural knowledge with modern technology
            to ensure our milk is not only nutrient-rich but also ethically and sustainably produced. Our focus on
            pasture-raised cattle, non-GMO feed, and minimal waste operations positions us uniquely in a growing niche
            market.
